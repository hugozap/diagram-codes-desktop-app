# Diagram.codes Studio User Manual.

## Welcome to Diagram.codes Studio (DCS)

DCS allows users to quickly create diagrams using simple text conventions. 
With this approach the user can focus on the information and its relations instead
of having to manually arrange elements to create the diagram (a time consuming process). DCS automatically
finds a visual arrangement.
